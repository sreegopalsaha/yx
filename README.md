# backend

This project was scaffolded using [bkite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-bkite), a tool designed to help developers set up a production-ready backend with ease.

## Features

- Pre-configured project structure for fast development.
- Support for modern backend frameworks and tools.
- Scalable architecture with routes, controllers, and models.
- Example configurations for environment variables and database connections.

## Getting Started

To get started with your backend project, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```

## File Structure

```
